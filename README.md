Deep learning

Build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction of daily bike rental ridership. By building a neural network from the ground up, I'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before moving to higher-level tools such as PyTorch.
